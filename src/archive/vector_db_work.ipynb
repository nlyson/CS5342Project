       " 'Since the publication of the\\nfirst edition 16 years ago, our book has been adopted for use at many hundreds of colleges and universities,\\ntranslated into 14 languages, and used by over one hundred thousand students and practitioners worldwide.',\n",
       " 'We’ve heard from many of these readers and have been overwhelmed by the \\xadpositive \\xadresponse.',\n",
       " 'What’s New in the Seventh Edition?',\n",
       " 'We think one important reason for this success has been that our book continues to offer a fresh and timely\\napproach to computer networking instruction.',\n",
       " 'We’ve made changes in this seventh edition, but we’ve also kept\\nunchanged what we believe (and the instructors and students who have used our book have confirmed) to be\\nthe most important aspects of this book: its top-down approach, its focus on the Internet and a modern\\ntreatment of computer networking, its attention to both principles and practice, and its accessible style and\\napproach toward learning about computer networking.',\n",
       " 'Nevertheless, the seventh edition has been revised and\\nupdated substantially.',\n",
       " 'Long-time readers of our book will notice that for the first time since this text was published, we’ve changed the\\norganization of the chapters themselves.',\n",
       " 'The network layer, which had been previously covered in a single\\nchapter, is now covered in Chapter 4 (which focuses on the so-called “data plane” component of the network\\nlayer) and Chapter 5 (which focuses on the network layer’s “control plane”).',\n",
       " 'This expanded coverage of the\\nnetwork layer reflects the swift rise in importance of software-defined networking (SDN), arguably the most\\nimportant and exciting advance in networking in decades.',\n",
       " 'Although a relatively recent innovation, SDN has\\nbeen rapidly adopted in practice—so much so that it’s already hard to imagine an introduction to modern\\ncomputer networking that doesn’t cover SDN.',\n",
       " 'The topic of network management, previously covered in\\nChapter 9, has now been folded into the new Chapter 5.',\n",
       " 'As always, we’ve also updated many other sections\\nof the text to reflect recent changes in the dynamic field of networking since the sixth edition.',\n",
       " 'As always,\\nmaterial that has been retired from the printed text can always be found on this book’s Companion Website.',\n",
       " 'The most important updates are the following:\\nChapter 1 has been updated to reflect the ever-growing reach and use of the \\xadInternet.',\n",
       " 'Chapter 2, which covers the application layer, has been significantly updated.',\n",
       " 'We’ve removed the material\\non the FTP protocol and distributed hash tables to make room for a new section on application-level video\\nstreaming and \\xadcontent distribution networks, together with Netflix and YouTube case studies.',\n",
       " 'The\\nsocket programming sections have been updated from Python 2 to Python 3.',\n",
       " 'Chapter 3, which covers the transport layer, has been modestly updated.',\n",
       " 'The \\xadmaterial on asynchronous\\ntransport mode (ATM) networks has been replaced by more modern material on the Internet’s explicit\\ncongestion notification (ECN), which teaches the same principles.',\n",
       " 'Chapter 4 covers the “data plane” component of the network layer—the per-router  forwarding function that\\ndetermine how a packet arriving on one of a router’s input links is forwarded to one of that router’s output\\nlinks.',\n",
       " 'We updated the material on traditional Internet forwarding found in all previous editions, and added\\nmaterial on packet scheduling.',\n",
       " 'We’ve also added a new section on generalized forwarding, as practiced in\\nSDN.',\n",
       " 'There are also numerous updates throughout the chapter.',\n",
       " 'Material on multicast and broadcast\\ncommunication has been removed to make way for the new material.',\n",
       " 'In Chapter 5, we cover the control plane functions of the network layer—the \\xadnetwork-wide  logic that\\ncontrols how a datagram is routed along an end-to-end path of routers from the source host to the\\ndestination host.',\n",
       " 'As in previous \\xadeditions, we cover routing algorithms, as well as routing protocols (with an\\nupdated treatment of BGP) used in today’s Internet.',\n",
       " 'We’ve added a significant new section on the SDN\\ncontrol plane, where routing and other functions are implemented in so-called SDN controllers.',\n",
       " 'Chapter 6, which now covers the link layer, has an updated treatment of Ethernet, and of data center\\nnetworking.',\n",
       " 'Chapter 7, which covers wireless and mobile networking, contains updated \\xadmaterial on 802.11 (so-called\\n“WiFi) networks and cellular networks, including 4G and LTE.',\n",
       " 'Chapter 8, which covers network security and was extensively updated in the sixth edition, has only',\n",
       " 'modest updates in this seventh edition.',\n",
       " 'Chapter 9, on multimedia networking, is now slightly “thinner” than in the sixth edition, as material on video\\nstreaming and content distribution networks has been moved to Chapter 2, and material on packet\\nscheduling has been incorporated into Chapter 4.',\n",
       " 'Significant new material involving end-of-chapter problems has been added.',\n",
       " 'As with all previous editions,\\nhomework problems have been revised, added, and removed.',\n",
       " 'As always, our aim in creating this new edition of our book is to continue to provide a focused and modern\\ntreatment of computer networking, emphasizing both principles and practice.',\n",
       " 'Audience\\nThis textbook is for a first course on computer networking.',\n",
       " 'It can be used in both computer science and\\nelectrical engineering departments.',\n",
       " 'In terms of programming languages, the book assumes only that the\\nstudent has experience with C, C++, Java, or Python (and even then only in a few places).',\n",
       " 'Although this book\\nis more precise and analytical than many other introductory computer networking texts, it rarely uses any\\nmathematical concepts that are not taught in high school.',\n",
       " 'We have made a deliberate effort to avoid using any\\nadvanced calculus, probability, or stochastic process concepts (although we’ve included some homework\\nproblems for students with this advanced background).',\n",
       " 'The book is therefore appropriate for undergraduate\\ncourses and for first-year graduate courses.',\n",
       " 'It should also be useful to practitioners in the telecommunications\\nindustry.',\n",
       " 'What Is Unique About This Textbook?',\n",
       " 'The subject of computer networking is enormously complex, involving many concepts, protocols, and\\ntechnologies that are woven together in an intricate manner.',\n",
       " 'To cope with this scope and complexity, many\\ncomputer networking texts are often organized around the “layers” of a network architecture.',\n",
       " 'With a layered\\norganization, students can see through the complexity of computer networking—they learn about the distinct\\nconcepts and protocols in one part of the architecture while seeing the big picture of how all parts fit together.',\n",
       " 'From a pedagogical perspective, our personal experience has been that such a layered approach indeed\\nworks well.',\n",
       " 'Nevertheless, we have found that the traditional approach of teaching—bottom up; that is, from the\\nphysical layer towards the application layer—is not the best approach for a modern course on computer\\nnetworking.',\n",
       " 'A Top-Down Approach\\nOur book broke new ground 16 years ago by treating networking in a top-down \\xadmanner—that is, by\\nbeginning at the application layer and working its way down toward the physical layer.',\n",
       " 'The feedback we\\nreceived from teachers and students alike have confirmed that this top-down approach has many advantages\\nand does indeed work well pedagogically.',\n",
       " 'First, it places emphasis on the application layer (a “high growth\\narea” in networking).',\n",
       " 'Indeed, many of the recent revolutions in \\xadcomputer networking—including the Web,\\npeer-to-peer file sharing, and media streaming—have taken place at the application layer.',\n",
       " 'An early emphasis\\non application-layer issues differs from the approaches taken in most other texts, which have only a small\\namount of material on network applications, their requirements, application-layer paradigms (e.g., client-server\\nand peer-to-peer), and application programming \\xadinterfaces.',\n",
       " '\\xadSecond, our experience as instructors (and that\\nof many instructors who have used this text) has been that teaching networking applications near the\\nbeginning of the course is a powerful motivational tool.',\n",
       " 'Students are thrilled to learn about how networking',\n",
       " 'applications work—applications such as e-mail and the Web, which most students use on a daily basis.',\n",
       " 'Once\\na student understands the applications, the student can then understand the network services needed to\\nsupport these applications.',\n",
       " 'The student can then, in turn, examine the various ways in which such services\\nmight be provided and implemented in the lower layers.',\n",
       " 'Covering applications early thus provides motivation\\nfor the remainder of the text.',\n",
       " 'Third, a top-down approach enables instructors to introduce network application development at an early\\nstage.',\n",
       " 'Students not only see how popular applications and protocols work, but also learn how easy it is to\\ncreate their own network \\xadapplications and application-level protocols.',\n",
       " 'With the top-down approach, students\\nget early \\xadexposure to the notions of socket programming, service models, and \\xadprotocols—important\\nconcepts that resurface in all subsequent layers.',\n",
       " 'By providing socket programming examples in Python, we\\nhighlight the central ideas without confusing students with complex code.',\n",
       " 'Undergraduates in electrical\\nengineering and computer science should not have difficulty following the Python code.',\n",
       " 'An Internet Focus\\nAlthough we dropped the phrase “Featuring the Internet” from the title of this book with the fourth edition, this\\ndoesn’t mean that we dropped our focus on the Internet.',\n",
       " 'Indeed, nothing could be further from the case!',\n",
       " 'Instead, since the Internet has become so pervasive, we felt that any networking textbook must have a\\nsignificant focus on the Internet, and thus this phrase was somewhat unnecessary.',\n",
       " 'We continue to use the\\nInternet’s architecture and protocols as primary vehicles for studying fundamental computer networking\\nconcepts.',\n",
       " 'Of course, we also include concepts and protocols from other network architectures.',\n",
       " 'But the\\nspotlight is clearly on the Internet, a fact reflected in our organizing the book around the Internet’s five-layer\\narchitecture: the application, transport, network, link, and physical layers.',\n",
       " 'Another benefit of spotlighting the Internet is that most computer science and electrical engineering students\\nare eager to learn about the Internet and its protocols.',\n",
       " 'They know that the Internet has been a revolutionary\\nand disruptive technology and can see that it is profoundly changing our world.',\n",
       " 'Given the enormous relevance\\nof the Internet, students are naturally curious about what is “under the hood.” Thus, it is easy for an instructor\\nto get students excited about basic principles when using the Internet as the guiding focus.',\n",
       " 'Teaching Networking Principles\\nTwo of the unique features of the book—its top-down approach and its focus on the Internet—have appeared\\nin the titles of our book.',\n",
       " 'If we could have squeezed a third phrase into the subtitle, it would have contained the\\nword principles.',\n",
       " 'The field of networking is now mature enough that a number of fundamentally important issues\\ncan be identified.',\n",
       " 'For example, in the transport layer, the fundamental issues include reliable communication\\nover an unreliable network layer, connection establishment/ teardown and handshaking, congestion and flow\\ncontrol, and multiplexing.',\n",
       " 'Three fundamentally important network-layer issues are determining “good” paths\\nbetween two routers, interconnecting a large number of heterogeneous networks, and managing the\\ncomplexity of a modern network.',\n",
       " 'In the link layer, a fundamental problem is sharing a multiple access channel.',\n",
       " 'In network security, techniques for providing confidentiality, authentication, and message integrity are all based\\non cryptographic fundamentals.',\n",
       " 'This text identifies fundamental networking issues and studies approaches\\ntowards addressing these issues.',\n",
       " 'The student learning these principles will gain knowledge with a long “shelf\\nlife”—long after today’s network standards and protocols have become obsolete, the principles they embody\\nwill remain important and relevant.',\n",
       " 'We believe that the combination of using the Internet to get the student’s\\nfoot in the door and then emphasizing fundamental issues and solution approaches will allow the student to',\n",
       " 'quickly understand just about any networking technology.',\n",
       " 'The Website\\nEach new copy of this textbook includes twelve months of access to a Companion \\xadWebsite for all book\\nreaders at http:/ /www.pearsonhighered.com/ cs-resources/ , which includes:\\nInteractive learning material.',\n",
       " 'The book’s Companion Website contains \\xadVideoNotes—video\\npresentations of important topics throughout the book done by the authors, as well as walkthroughs of\\nsolutions to problems similar to those at the end of the chapter.',\n",
       " 'We’ve seeded the Web site with\\nVideoNotes and \\xadonline problems for Chapters 1 through 5 and will continue to actively add and update\\nthis material over time.',\n",
       " 'As in earlier editions, the Web site contains the interactive Java applets that\\nanimate many key networking concepts.',\n",
       " 'The site also has interactive quizzes that permit students to check\\ntheir basic understanding of the subject matter.',\n",
       " 'Professors can integrate these interactive features into their\\nlectures or use them as mini labs.',\n",
       " 'Additional technical material.',\n",
       " 'As we have added new material in each edition of our book, we’ve had to\\nremove coverage of some existing topics to keep the book at manageable length.',\n",
       " 'For example, to make\\nroom for the new \\xadmaterial in this \\xadedition, we’ve removed material on FTP, distributed hash tables, and\\nmulticasting, Material that appeared in earlier editions of the text is still of \\xadinterest, and thus can be found\\non the book’s Web site.',\n",
       " 'Programming assignments.',\n",
       " 'The Web site also provides a number of detailed programming assignments,\\nwhich include building a multithreaded Web \\xadserver, building an e-mail client with a GUI interface,\\nprogramming the sender and \\xadreceiver sides of a reliable data transport protocol, programming a\\ndistributed routing algorithm, and more.',\n",
       " 'Wireshark labs.',\n",
       " 'One’s understanding of network protocols can be greatly \\xaddeepened by seeing them in\\naction.',\n",
       " 'The Web site provides numerous Wireshark assignments that enable students to actually observe\\nthe sequence of messages exchanged between two protocol entities.',\n",
       " 'The Web site includes separate\\nWireshark labs on HTTP, DNS, TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP, Ethernet, ARP, WiFi, SSL, and on tracing all\\nprotocols involved in satisfying a request to fetch a Web page.',\n",

       " 'Since students can generate (and view\\nsolutions for) an unlimited number of similar problem instances, they can work until the material is truly\\nmastered.',\n",
       " 'Pedagogical Features\\nWe have each been teaching computer networking for more than 30 years.',\n",
       " 'Together, we bring more than 60\\nyears of teaching experience to this text, during which time we have taught many thousands of students.',\n",
